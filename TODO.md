UI Playground ToDos
===================

 * PanelContainers that shrink with children
 * Font size too small on large external monitors
   * Idea: Set min size as % of window height?
 * Joysticks
   * Map buttons to layout and add on-screen indicators
   * On-screen indicators for buttons and analog sticks
 * Camera control movement indicator
   * "Dust" particle system
 * Gyro
   * Rotate camera so in-game horizon matches real world
 * Implement touch input/control for on-screen analog sticks
 * Automatically configure HUD components for latest input used
   * Analog circle (touch or joy) vs keys (WASD or arrows)
